# Analysis-Bot

This project implements a financial chatbot that provides insights about a company's financial growth over a range of fiscal years. The chatbot answers queries about key financial metrics, such as revenue, net income, assets, liabilities, and cash flow. It uses historical financial data of major tech companies like Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla. The chatbot leverages Python's data manipulation libraries (like Pandas, NumPy) to compute year-over-year growth rates and provide dynamic responses to user queries.
